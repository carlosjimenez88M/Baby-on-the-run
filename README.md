# Baby on the run

![](jetson.jpeg)

This project falls under the category of Edge Computing, where I am attempting to create a computer vision model that is not based on pre-trained models. The purpose is to detect when a baby is in danger or escaping from the crib. For this, the images I use to train the model will be available in a folder on Drive, and in this repository, I will work on the model's design and implementation.

The model will perform inference on a Jetson Nano, so the coding and other aspects will be based on this requirement. Secondly, the model will run on Tensorflow. The deployment will be done within a Docker container, and instead of having a unit test scenario, I will perform an out-of-the-box (OOB) evaluation to verify the model's relevance.

I will provide a notebook with the main model designs, in terms of artifacts, but for this, I will rely on a tree structure of this repository, which will describe how this system works from the perspective of a Machine Learning Developer.
